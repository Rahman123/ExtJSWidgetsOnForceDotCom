A collection of examples for using ExtJS widgets with Salesforce.com data as a back end.

To use these, you need to create and upload an ExtJS "resource", which is just a zip file containing the
ExtJS distribution.  You can remove any unneeded parts (samples, documentation) before uploading to your org.
Name the resource ExtJS and update the version numbers in the components as needed to reflect the version of
Ext you are actually using.  At this time only ExtJS versions 3.X are supported.
